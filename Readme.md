# First step :

For ReSpeaker USB Mic Array - Far-field w/ 7 PDM Microphones. Change the Mic Array's firmware to get 8 channels raw audio. 
See https://github.com/respeaker/mic_array_dfu
### On linux
```
$ sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev 
$ git clone https://github.com/respeaker/mic_array_dfu.git
$ cd mic_array_dfu

# Second step :
## Get ReSpeaker Python Library
[ReSpeaker](https://respeaker.io/) is an open project to create voice enabled objects. ReSpeaker python library is an open source python library to provide basic functions of voice interaction.
It uses [PocketSphinx](https://github.com/cmusphinx/pocketsphinx) for keyword spotting and uses [webrtcvad](https://github.com/wiseman/py-webrtcvad) for voice activity detecting.
See [original github repository link](https://github.com/respeaker/respeaker_python_library/blob/master/README.md)
### On linux
```
pip install pocketsphinx webrtcvad
pip install pyaudio respeaker --upgrade
```
#### if you only need to get data that respeaker recorded, you can skip the second step.

# Final step :
```
python get_index.py
```
You have to get the respeaker index first, than check wheather it is same as the variable RESPEAKER_INDEX in record.py.
```
python record.py
